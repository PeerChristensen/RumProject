Does sugar content predict rum ratings? Scripts for scraping, cleaning and analysing data

In order to reproduce the analysis, complete the following steps:
1. Run PChristensenScraper.py
2. Run rumInfoClean.R and rumSugarClean.R
3. Run rumAnalysis.R
Note: Remember to change the working directory before running the scripts!

This repository also contains a webscraping tutorial in notebook format and a presentation file (using R) demonstrating various methods for analyzing the data.
